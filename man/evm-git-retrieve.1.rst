Description

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
Git is enables publishing and retrieving
git repositories onto Ethereum Virtual Machine
compatible blockchains.
It uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine File System
for storage.

against deployers or users' EVM GNU Privacy Guard
keys published on the EVM OpenPGP Key Server,
so to avoid users from potentially
malevolent RPC endpoints and
man-in-the-middle attacks.

It depends on the EVM Contracts Tools
to interact with EVM networks and it is
written using the LibEVM and the Crash Bash
libraries.
